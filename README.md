# Elm History Wrapper

This is a wrapper to create a personal history. The goal is to be able to track the usage of the app and to replay it.

The Elm History also works quite well but building a pesonal history allow for more fine grained control.

The idea is elaborated also in a fun post (https://hackernoon.com/a-user-encounters-a-javascript-error-youll-never-guess-what-happens-next-dc1a6f725490) by David Gilbertson.

The code come from an Ellie example (https://ellie-app.com/4DDZ2QrT3a1/0) that I believe was originally written by Ilias Van Peer
